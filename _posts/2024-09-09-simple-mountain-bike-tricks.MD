Top 5 Mountain Biking Tricks to Master


Learning new tricks can elevate your mountain biking skills and make rides more exciting. Here are five mountain biking tricks to master.


1. The Wheelie

A classic trick, the wheelie, involves lifting the front wheel off the ground while riding. Start at a moderate speed, shift your weight back, and pull up on the handlebars while pedaling consistently. Practice maintaining balance and controlling the front wheel.


2. The Bunny Hop

The bunny hop allows you to lift both wheels off the ground simultaneously, useful for clearing obstacles. Shift your weight back, pull up on the handlebars, then scoop your legs upward, lifting the rear wheel. Timing and coordination are key.


3. Manual

Manuals are like wheelies but without pedaling. Shift your weight over the rear wheel and pull up on the handlebars. Use your legs to control the balance. Manuals help you navigate through rough or technical sections of trails.


4. Endo or Stoppie

The endo involves lifting the rear wheel off the ground by applying front brake pressure and shifting your weight forward. Timing is crucial to prevent tipping over. Endos can help improve your bike handling skills and prepare you for more advanced tricks.


5. Track Stand

A track stand is balancing on the bike without moving. This trick enhances your control and stability, aiding in technical sections or slow-speed maneuvers. Practice balancing while stationary, using small forward and backward movements to maintain equilibrium.
