Understanding Mountain Bike Suspension: A Comprehensive Guide


Mountain bike suspension is crucial for comfort and control on rough terrains. Here’s a comprehensive guide to understanding suspension systems.


Types of Suspension

Hardtail: Equipped with front suspension only. Ideal for cross-country and less technical trails. They are lighter and more affordable.

Full Suspension: Features both front and rear suspension. Provides better traction, control, and comfort on rough and technical terrains. Suitable for trail, enduro, and downhill riding.

Suspension Components

Fork: The front suspension component. It absorbs impacts on the front wheel, improving control and reducing fatigue.

Shock: The rear suspension component. It absorbs impacts on the rear wheel, maintaining wheel contact and improving stability.

Suspension Travel

The amount of movement in the suspension is known as travel. It affects how the bike handles different terrains.


Short Travel (100-130mm): Suited for cross-country and less technical trails. Provides efficient pedalling with minimal weight penalty.

Mid Travel (130-160mm): Versatile, suitable for trail and all-mountain riding. Balances climbing efficiency with descending capability.

Long Travel (160mm and above): Optimal for downhill and aggressive riding. Offers maximum impact absorption and control on rough descents.

Suspension Settings

Sag: The amount the suspension compresses under the rider’s weight. Proper sag ensures the suspension works effectively over varied terrain.

Rebound: Controls how quickly the suspension returns after compression. Adjust for a controlled return to avoid bouncing.

Compression: Adjusts the resistance to impacts. Setting varies for different terrains and personal preference.
